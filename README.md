2. DHT11 Sensor
3. Jumper Wires 
4. Mobile Device for Testing
5. USB Cable for NodeMCU
6. Computer with Arduino IDE installed


Software:
1. Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
2. DHT Sensor Library (for Arduino IDE)
3. Thing Speak Platform Account
4. MIT App Inventor (for mobile application development)

**PROCEDURE:**

1. **Setup Arduino IDE and Install Libraries:**
   - Download and install the Arduino IDE on your computer.
   - Open Arduino IDE and install the necessary libraries, including the DHT Sensor Library and ESP8266 WiFi Client, through the Library Manager.
   - Ensure that the CP102x Driver Software is installed for NodeMCU compatibility.

2. **Connect Hardware Components:**
   - Arrange the NodeMCU ESP8266, DHT11 sensor, and jumper wires on a breadboard.
   - Connect the DHT11 sensor to the NodeMCU using jumper wires, ensuring proper pin connections.
   - Use another set of jumper wires to connect the NodeMCU to the computer via USB for power and programming.

3. **Configure Arduino IDE for NodeMCU:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and select the appropriate board (NodeMCU ESP8266) and port from the Tools menu.
   - Configure the IDE's board manager to download any required additional packages.

4. **Write and Upload Code:**
   - Write the C code for the Temperature Alert System in the Arduino IDE.
   - Ensure that the code includes instructions for reading sensor data, establishing WiFi connection, and MQTT communication with ThingSpeak.
   - Compile the code and upload it to the NodeMCU ESP8266.

5. **Setup ThingSpeak IoT Platform:**
   - Create an account on the ThingSpeak IoT platform.
   - Set up a new channel on ThingSpeak to receive and visualize temperature data.
   - Obtain the ThingSpeak channel ID and API key.

6. **Develop Mobile Application with MIT App Inventor:**
   - Access MIT App Inventor and create a new project.
   - Design the user interface to display temperature readings and alerts.
   - Implement the MQTT protocol to receive real-time data from ThingSpeak.
   - Program the app to trigger alerts when predefined temperature thresholds are exceeded.

7. **Test the System:**
   - Power on the NodeMCU and ensure it connects to the WiFi network.
   - Verify that temperature data is successfully sent to ThingSpeak and is visible on the platform's dashboard.
   - Test the mobile application by running it on a mobile device.
   - Simulate normal and high-temperature scenarios to confirm the app's alerting functionality.

8. **Address Challenges and Debug:**
   - Address any recognition issues with libraries by periodically reinstalling them.
   - Verify and use the correct versions of libraries to ensure smooth code execution.
   - Troubleshoot and resolve any memory usage errors encountered during the implementation.
   - Handle any malfunctions or issues with the DHT11 sensor.

By following these steps, you can effectively implement the Temperature Alert System using Arduino IDE, NodeMCU ESP8266, DHT11 sensor, ThingSpeak IoT platform, and MIT App Inventor, ensuring successful real-time temperature monitoring and alerting.
