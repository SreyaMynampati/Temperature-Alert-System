# Temperature-Alert-System
Temperature Alert System using Arduino IDE, NodeMCU ESP8266, and DHT11 sensor. The system will measure temperature, send the data to the Thing Speak IoT platform for storage and visualization, and transmit real-time alerts to a mobile application developed with MIT App Inventor when predefined temperature thresholds are exceeded.
